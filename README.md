# 🙋‍♂️ _Hi, friend! Pleased to meet you._

I'm not super active on Github at the moment and many of my personal pet-projects are banished to private repositories until they are mature enough to see the light of day and not scare anyone off. 🙄

I strongly believe that one of the best investments in life is an investment in your own knowledge and skills, and I always look out for opportunities to discover new things within my role and outside it.

I'm always happy to have a conversation and share my views, however, please read the obligatory disclaimer below. 👇

>**Disclaimer:** all personal and professional views here are my own and do not reflect views of my current or any previous employers. All information shared is derived from publicly available sources or constitutes my personal opinion.

**Still with me? Great, happy to see you here and let this day be kind to you!**

## ``whoami``

### 👋 Intro

I am passionate about exploring core concepts and building prototypes using data analysis, creative coding and visualization techniques in order to present best practices in a structured and accessible way.

### 👨‍💻 Facts

* A few years ago I discovered _Site Reliability Engineering_ and decided to move to an _SRE_ role which was a natural choice given that I enjoy  working with systems metrics, reliability, capacity and performance characteristics.
* Prior to that I had been a _Software Developer_ working on backend services (Java, Perl, Go), bespoke data-processing pipelines and distributed infrastructure at scale.
* Most of my career I've been working at large size companies which usually provide sufficient stability, management processes, transparency and resources.
* I prefer to _work from home_, but enjoy hallway conversations and getting to know my coworkers.
* My ideal work week would have 2 days in the office, and 3 days working from home or a coworking space.

### 🗺 Location

I am currently based in **London, UK** which I really like for its mild weather, green spaces and architecture. I have no plans to move anywhere else at the moment.

From time to time I travel to the US and EU and I'm always interested in exploring new places and meeting people.

### 📈 Always choose growth.

"Try never to be the smartest person in the room. And if you are, I suggest you invite smarter people… or find a different room." [Michael Dell](https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00017301)

### 📊 Bring data, not opinions.

The only way to scale progress and bring more value to existing business processes is in consistent measuring, automation and analytics.
Every decision should be data-driven.

### 📃 No documentation - no product.

Docs, articles, tutorials and howto guides are a developer's first impression of your product and every day interaction with it.
You should be able to explain to people at whatever level they are how your product works and how they can start using it quickly and efficiently.

### 🎁 Give without expecting a return.

I always support and encourage people to the best of my ability. Sometimes these influences change lives and occasionally I get to find out how.
